## About Dataset

Hourly Electricity Consumption and Production by Type in Romania for 5.5 years.
It includes the hourly consumption and production, and the production is split in one of the categories: Nuclear, Wind, Hydroelectric, Oil and Gas, Coal, Solar, Biomass.
When the production is greater than the consumption it means we are exporting electricity, when the value is smaller it means we are importing electricity.<br>
All values are in MWs.
